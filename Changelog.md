## 2.3.2 (May 8, 2013)

Bugfixes:

  - Resolved an issue with additional whitespace present in the Git revision hash.

## 2.3.1 (Nov 14, 2013)

Bugfixes:

  - Resolved an issue with deployment tags being applied to commits which weren't yet pushed to the remote.

## 2.3.0 (Nov 14, 2013)

Features:

  - Switch from using annotated tags to using lightweight tags, to ensure the git refs match between commit and tag.

## 2.2.1 (Oct 4, 2013)

Bugfixes:

  - Fixed an issue in some environments where the `inproduction` tag is not successfully moved if it already exists on the remote.

## 2.2.0 (Sep 17, 2013)

Features:

  - Tagging should now be quicker, due to a reduction in the number of requests made to Git.

## 2.1.0 (Sep 16, 2013)

Features:

  - You can now disable adding timestamp tags alongside the `inproduction` tag by seting `:update_deploy_timestamp_tags` to `false` in your `deploy.rb`.
  - You can customise the timestamp tags prefix by setting `:latest_deploy_timestamp_tag_prefix` in your `deploy.rb`, for example `set :latest_deploy_timestamp_tag_prefix, "staging"`.

## 2.0.3 (Sep 5, 2012)

Fixed:

  - The message about how to enable updating tags is no longer shown when an automatic deployment is performed (see ['Special Usage'](https://github.com/forward/capistrano-deploy-tagger/blob/master/readme.md#special-usage) for more on this feature).

## 2.0.2 (Aug 2, 2012)

Fixed:

  - The homepage field in the gemspec was incorrect.

## 2.0.1 (Aug 1, 2012)

Fixed:

  - The `deploy:tagger:tag` task was being incorrectly called after the deployment.

## 2.0.0 (Aug 1, 2012)

Renamed the gem to Capistrano-Deploy-Tagger. It now creates a specified tag with timestamp for each deploy, as well as a moving tag representing the latest deploy. This makes it easy to see at a glance which revisions were ever in production.

If you're migrating over from the ['capistrano-ec2-selfdeploy-tag'](https://rubygems.org/gems/capistrano-ec2-selfdeploy-tag) gem, you'll need to remove your previous configuration as property names have changed.

Features:

  - When you run a standard `cap deploy`, the `inproduction` tag is updated to refer to the revision that was just deployed.

  - In addition, the revision is also tagged in the format `deploy-YEARMONTHDAY-HOURMIN-SECS` which gives you a history of revisions that were deployed to production.

  - You can change the name of the production tag from `inproduction` by setting `:latest_deploy_tag` in your `deploy.rb`.

  - You can also prevent updating tags by setting `:update_deploy_tags` to false in your `deploy.rb`.

Fixed:
 
 - Errors were being shown when initially creating the `inproduction` tag.

## 1.0.3 (November 16, 2011)

Bugfix:

  - Suddenly started failing on a subset of servers, related to not requiring rubygems or capistrano.

## 1.0.2 (September 14, 2011)

  - Added a dummy `deploy:first_time` task. Override this task in your project if there are commands that need to be run the first time a project deploys, but not during each subsequent deploy.

## 1.0.1 (September 13, 2011)

Bugfixes:

  - When `:update_selfdeploy_tag` is set to `false`, we no longer exit with a status of 1.

## 1.0.0 (June 13, 2011)

Features:

  - Running a standard `cap deploy` will move the `inproduction` tag to whatever commit was just deployed.
  - You can `set :selfdeploy_tag, "your_tag_name"` to change the tag name used.
  - You can prevent the tag from being moved for specific tasks by using `set :update_selfdeploy_tag, false`.
  - Running `cap ec2_instance deploy` ensures the deployment takes place from the `inproduction` tag and prevents the tag from being moved. Use this task with your autoscaling self deployments.
